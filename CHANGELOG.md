All notable changes to nimiq.bitmesh. Each PR bumps the version and adds an entry.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- Project bootstrap: `docs/GOAL.md` (north star, demo loop, core values),
  `docs/LOOP.md` (autonomous build contract, goals G1–G13, money-path gating),
  `docs/adr/0001` (native Swift + Kotlin + shared Rust core via UniFFI),
  `docs/PROTOCOL.md` (bitmesh wire format), `docs/RISKS.md` (offline-payment hazards),
  `nimiq-stack.json` (fleet manifest, marked exempt — native, not a web PWA), and the
  CI plan in `docs/ci/`.
- Outcome of the `bitmesh-design-spike` dynamic workflow (4 research agents + synthesis):
  empirically confirmed 139-byte signed transfer, RFC-8032 Ed25519 signing, Bitchat =
  Unlicense (portable), ~2 h validity window.
